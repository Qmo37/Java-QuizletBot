Java Programming, 10e. Chapter 02: Using Data. Joyce Farrell, Java Programming, 10th Edition. May not be scanned, copied or duplicated, or posted to a publicly accessible website, in whole or in part. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:. 01 Declare and use constants and variables. 02 Use integer data types. 03 Use the boolean data type. 04 Use floating-point data types. 05 Use the char data type. 06 Use the Scanner class to accept keyboard input. 07 Use the JOptionPane class to accept GUI input. 08 Perform arithmetic using variables and constants. 09 Describe type conversion. Briefly review with students the major concepts you will be covering during this class. There is one objective for every major A-Head section of the chapter. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (1 of 8). Cannot be changed while program is running. Value taken literally at each use. As opposed to a literal constant. No identifier is associated with it. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (2 of 8). A named memory location. Used to store a value. Can hold only one value at a time. A type of data that can be stored. How much memory an item occupies. What types of operations can be performed on data. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (3 of 8). Examples: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean. More complex data types. Examples: System, Scanner. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (4 of 8). Statement that reserves a memory location. Data type of variable. Identifier (variableâ€™s name). Optional assignment operator and value. Java is a strongly typed language. Camel casing example: lastName. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (5 of 8). The value to the right is assigned to the variable on the left. An assignment made when declaring a variable. An assignment made after a variable is declared. The order in which operands are used with operators. lvalue (left) and rvalue (right). 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (6 of 8). Uninitialized variable. Declared within a method but no value assigned. Garbage value is unknown value. Also known as symbolic constant. Has data type, name value. Preceded by keyword final. Can only be assigned a value once. Identifiers are uppercase and use underscores. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (7 of 8). The area in which a data item is visible to a program, and in which you can refer to it using its simple identifier. A variable or constant is in scope from the point it is declared. Until the end of the block of code where the declaration lies. 1 Declaring and Using Constants and Variables (8 of 8). A numeric variable is concatenated to a String using the plus sign. The entire expression becomes a String. Use a dialog box to display values. 2 Learning About Integer Data Types (1 of 1). Whole number without decimal places. int, byte, short and long. If you attempt to assign a value too large for the data type of variable, the compiler issues an error message. If you choose a data type larger than you need, you waste memory.
